![Consigne](Consigne.png)


We have a `kiddie_pool.png` where we can see that
![Kiddie Pool Original](kiddie_pool.png)


We can see that there is a rotation of a text.
By using Gimp, we just have to rotate in the other way with the tool `Filters>Distorts>Whirls and Pinch`
Results :
![Kiddie Pool with flag !!](kiddie_pool_derotated.png)


And we get the flag `flag{whirlpool_in_a_cinch}`
